TITLE=Extreme Aspect Ratio
\P//~

COMMENT=A hand crafted sixel file that uses an extreme aspect ratio in
the Raster Attributes ('"') of 80:1. That is, it is 80 times taller
than it is wide. The VT340 shows this replicating each pixel in the
image vertically, causing each sixel to be 480 screen pixels high.

Technically, a Level 2 Sixel compliant file should not expect a sixel
device to be able to handle an aspect ratio where the numerator
(vertical) or denominator (horizontal) exceed 10. But this one goes to
eleven...

Note: Timing tests indicate that the VT340 takes about the same amount
of time to render no matter if the aspect ratio is 1:1 to 100000:1.
