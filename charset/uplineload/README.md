[![Technical Character Set glyphs)](char-tcs.gif)

This program shows each glyph from the Technical Character Set on the
screen of a VT340 and then saves a bitmap of it using the MediaCopy
escape sequence.

This should compile easily with any reasonably modern C compiler.
(Just type `make`). See the [tcs](tcs) subdirectory for the individual
glyphs.
