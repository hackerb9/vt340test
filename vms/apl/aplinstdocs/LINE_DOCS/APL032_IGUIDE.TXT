________________________________________________________________

   This document describes how to install VAX APL on the VMS
   operating system. It is intended for system managers. This
   document applies to VAX APL Version 3.2. A major version num-
   ber is represented by the digits to the left of the decimal
   point, and the maintenance update version number is indicated
   by the digits to the right of the decimal point.

   Keep this document with your distribution kit. You will need
   it to reinstall VAX APL for any other reason.

   At the back of this document are two Reader's Comments forms.
   If you have any comments about this document, fill out one
   form and mail it; your comments will be considered for the
   next revision of the installation guide.

   For more information about installing VAX APL on VMS systems,
   see your processor-specific installation/operations guide.

   The installation procedure is described step-by-step and is,
   for the most part, self-explanatory. The system prompts you
   to answer questions and to change volumes, and waits for you
   to tell it to continue.

   This installation guide contains samples from an installation
   of VAX APL. These samples may not be exact replications of
   the installation output.

Preparing to Install VAX APL

   Your bill of materials (BOM) and indented bills report (BIL)
   specify the number and contents of your media. Be sure to
   check the contents of your kit against this information.
   If your kit is damaged or if you find that parts of it are
   missing, call your Digital customer services representative.

   Distribution media must be mounted in numerical order. The
   installation procedure prompts you to mount the volumes. For
   more information on how to mount distribution media, see your
   processor-specific installation/operations guide, which also
   details several options to the installation procedure.

__________________________________________________________

Prerequisite Software

   VAX APL Version 3.2 requires VMS Version 5.2 or higher.

   VAX APL Version 3.2 requires VMS Workstation Software Version
   4.1 or DECwindows Version 2.0 on VMS Version 5.3 or higher on
   VAXstations to support the APL character set.

   Contact your Digital customer services representative if
   you have questions about the compatibility of other soft-
   ware products with this version of VAX APL. You can re-
   quest the most recent copy of the VAX System Software Order
   Table/Optional Software Cross Reference Table, which will
   verify which versions of your operating system are compatible
   with this version of VAX APL.

                                NOTE

       If you are using a VAXstation and accessing a host VAX
       system to run VAX APL, VAX APL must be installed on
       both the host VAX system and the VAXstation.

__________________________________________________________

Accessing the Online Release Notes

   VAX APL provides online release notes. The prompt to display
   or print the release notes during the installation appears
   in Step 5 of the installation procedure when you invoke
   VMSINSTAL with the OPTIONS N parameter.

   To obtain the release notes after the installation, type
   or print the file SYS$HELP:APL032.RELEASE_NOTES. Online
   help also directs you to the release notes file. After the
   installation, type the following command:

     $ HELP APL RELEASE_NOTES <Return>

__________________________________________________________

Installation Procedure Requirements

   The installation takes approximately 10 to 45 minutes,
   depending on the type of media and your system configuration.
   Before installing VAX APL, you must have the following
   privileges and resources:

    o SETPRV privileges, or CMKRNL, WORLD, and SYSPRV privileges

    o A minimum of 7000 blocks of free disk space during
      installation; 5200 to 6100 blocks are used after
      installation depending on the optional files selected
      during installation

    o 20 contiguous free global pages and 4 global sections to
      install APLSHR.EXE as a protected shared image (required)

    o 950 contiguous free global pages and 2 global sections to
      install APL.EXE as a known shared image (optional)

    o 930 contiguous free global pages and 2 global sections to
      install QAPL.EXE as a known shared image (optional)

    o 100 contiguous free global pages and 1 global section to
      install APLMSG.EXE as a known shared image (optional)

2  VAX APL Installation Guide

 






    o Sufficient disk space (in blocks) for a copy of the file
      SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE

    o Buffered I/O byte count (BYTLM) of 8192 bytes (minimum)
      and subprocess creation quota of 1 (minimum) to prevent
      failure of the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

                                NOTE

       You must ensure that your system has the necessary
       global page and global section SYSGEN quotas for the
       installation. Failure to do so could cause the DCL
       tables to be corrupted in some situations.

   To determine the number of available global pages on
   your system, invoke the VMS Install Utility by typing the
   following command:

     $ INSTALL :== $INSTALL/COMMAND_MODE <Return>
     $ INSTALL <Return>

   Then, type the following command:

     INSTALL> LIST/GLOBAL/SUMMARY <Return>

             Summary of Local Memory Global Sections

     ?? Global Sections Used,  ???/???? Global Pages Used/Unused

     INSTALL> EXIT <Return>

   When you issue these commands, the system displays a summary
   of the number of global sections used, the number of global
   pages used, and the number of global pages unused. To exit
   from the VMS Install Utility, type the EXIT command and press
   <Return>.

   VAX APL requires the following global pages:

    o APLSHR: approximately 20 global pages (required)

    o APL: approximately 950 global pages (optional)

    o QAPL: approximately 930 global pages (optional)

    o APLMSG: approximately 100 global pages (optional)

                                    VAX APL Installation Guide 3

 






   If fewer pages are available, delete an existing known image
   with the VMS Install Utility, or increase the GBLPAGES system
   parameter with the VMS System Generation Utility (SYSGEN),
   editing the file SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT and then invoking
   the AUTOGEN command procedure, SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN.COM. For
   more information on the AUTOGEN command procedure, see your
   processor-specific installation/operations guide.

   You can determine the number of available global sections by
   invoking SYSGEN as follows:

     $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:SYSGEN <Return>
     SYSGEN> USE CURRENT <Return>
     SYSGEN> SHOW GBLSECTIONS <Return>

     SYSGEN> EXIT <Return>

   The last number displayed is the maximum number of global
   sections. Compare this number to the number of global
   sections in use displayed by the VMS Install Utility.

   If the number of global sections used plus the number needed
   by VAX APL exceeds the maximum number of global sections, you
   must increase the number of available global sections before
   you can install VAX APL.

   To increase the number, increase the GBLSECTIONS system
   parameter by editing the file SYS$SYSTEM:MODPARAMS.DAT
   and then invoking the SYS$UPDATE:AUTOGEN.COM procedure.
   For more information on the AUTOGEN.COM procedure, see your
   processor-specific installation/operations guide.

   If the number of global sections used plus the number needed
   to install VAX APL is less than the maximum number of global
   sections, you can exit from SYSGEN and continue.

User Account Quotas and Privileges

   To use VAX APL, each account must have TMPMBX and NETMBX
   privileges and the following requirements:

    o AST limit (ASTLM) 10 (minimum)

    o Buffered I/O quota (BIOLM) 10 (minimum)

    o Buffered I/O byte count quota (BYTLM) 8192 (minimum)

    o Direct I/O quota (DIOLM) 10 (minimum)

    o Enqueue quota (ENQLM) 10 (minimum)

    o Open file limit (FILLM) 10 (minimum)

    o Paging file quota (PGFLQUOTA) 2500 pages (minimum)

    o Subprocess creation quota (PRCLM) 3 (minimum)

    o Working set size (WSDEF) 250 pages (minimum) 500 or more
      pages recommended

   Use the VMS Authorize Utility (AUTHORIZE) to compare the
   current values of these quotas with the requirements for VAX
   APL. For example, the account used in the following example
   is the SYSTEM account:

     $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM <Return>
     $ RUN AUTHORIZE <Return>
     UAF> SHOW SYSTEM <Return>

   To change the values of these quotas, use the VMS Authorize
   Utility's MODIFY command. For more information, see the VMS
   Authorize Utility Manual.

__________________________________________________________

VMS License Management Facility

   The VMS License Management Facility (LMF) is available with
   Version 5.0 of the VMS operating system. You must register
   your VAX APL software license.

   The license registration information you need is contained in
   the Product Authorization Key (PAK) that is shipped with VAX
   APL. The PAK is a paper certificate that contains information
   about the license you have to run a particular piece of
   software.

   To register a license under VMS V5.0, first log in to the
   system manager's account, SYSTEM. You then have a choice of
   two ways to perform the registration:

    o Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When it
      prompts you for information, respond with data from your
      Product Authorization Key (PAK).

    o Issue the LICENSE REGISTER DCL command with the
      appropriate qualifiers that correspond to information
      on the PAK.

   For complete information on using LMF, see the VMS License
   Management Utility Manual in the VMS documentation set.

__________________________________________________________

Using VMSINSTAL

   After you log in to a privileged account to install VAX APL,
   invoke VMSINSTAL, the command procedure that installs this
   product. An example of this procedure is shown in Steps 1 and
   2 of the Installing VAX APL section.

   The VMSINSTAL command procedure has the following syntax:

     $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL APL032 ddcu: [OPTIONS N]

6  VAX APL Installation Guide

 






   VMSINSTAL prompts you for the product and device names if you
   do not supply these first two parameters. If you wish to be
   prompted for the product and device names and to display or
   print the release notes, type the following:

     $ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL <Return>

   You can also type an asterisk (*) in place of APL032. If you
   are installing from magnetic tape, you can use the asterisk
   to save installation time; the asterisk causes VAX APL to be
   installed with a minimum of tape passes.

   ddcu:
   Represents a device name where the distribution volumes
   will be mounted for the VAX APL installation media, where
   dd is the device code, c is the controller code, and u is the
   unit number. It is not necessary to use the console drive to
   install VAX APL. If you do use the console drive, after the
   installation, you should replace any media you removed from
   the drive. CSA1: is the device name used in examples in this
   document.

   OPTIONS N
   Is an optional parameter you should provide if you want
   to be prompted to display or print the release notes.
   If you do not include the OPTIONS N parameter, VMSINSTAL
   does not prompt you to display or print the release notes.
   VMSINSTAL permits the use of several other options. For more
   information on the other options, see your processor-specific
   installation/operations guide.

   When you invoke VMSINSTAL, it checks the following:
     o Whether you logged in to a privileged account. Digital
      recommends that you install software from the system
      manager's account with your default device and directory
      set to SYS$UPDATE.


                                    VAX APL Installation Guide 7

 






    o Whether you have adequate quotas for installation.
      VMSINSTAL checks for the following quota values:

       - ASTLM = 24

       - BIOLM = 18

       - BYTLM = 18000

       - DIOLM = 18

       - ENQLM = 30

       - FILLM = 20

   VMSINSTAL then checks whether the following conditions
   exist. If so, discontinue the conditions before resuming
   the installation procedure.

    o Whether DECnet is up and running

    o Whether any users are logged in to the system

   If VMSINSTAL detects either of these conditions, you will be
   asked whether you want to continue the installation. If you
   want to continue, type YES and press <Return>. If you want to
   stop the installation, type NO and press <Return>.

__________________________________________________________

Installing VAX APL

   This section contains excerpts from the installation
   procedure and explains each step. Defaults appear in brackets
   ([])  throughout the installation procedure. To use the
   default response, press <Return>.

   To abort the installation procedure at any time, press
   CTRL/Y. When you press CTRL/Y, the installation procedure
   deletes all files it has created up to that point and
   then returns you to DCL level. If you want to retry the
   installation procedure after pressing CTRL/Y, you must
   proceed from Step 2.

8  VAX APL Installation Guide

 






   Step 1: Log in to a privileged account and set your default
   device and directory to SYS$UPDATE.

     Please mount the first volume of the set on CSA1:.
     * Are you ready? YES <Return>
     The following products will be processed:

       VAX APL V3.2

       Beginning installation of VAX APL V3.2 at hh:mm

     %VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...

   To indicate that you want to continue the installation, mount
   the volume, type YES, and press <Return>.

   Step 4: Choose a release notes option.

   This step applies only if you specified OPTIONS N in Step 2.

     Release Notes Options:

         1. Display release notes
         2. Print release notes
         3. Both 1 and 2
         4. Copy release notes to SYS$HELP
         5. Do not display, print, or copy release notes

     * Select option [3]:

   Choose the appropriate option by entering the option number
   and pressing <Return>.

   If you choose option 1, VMSINSTAL displays the release notes
   on line immediately. You can terminate the display at any
   time by pressing CTRL/C.

   If you choose option 2, VMSINSTAL prompts you for a queue
   name. Either type a queue name or press <Return> to send the
   file to the default output print device.

     * Queue name [SYS$PRINT]: <Return>

10  VAX APL Installation Guide

 






   If you choose option 3, VMSINSTAL displays the release notes
   on line immediately. You can terminate the display at any
   time by pressing CTRL/C. VMSINSTAL then prompts you for a
   queue name. Either type a queue name or press <Return> to
   send the file to the default output print device.

   If you choose option 4, VMSINSTAL copies the release notes to
   SYS$HELP immediately.

   If you choose option 5, VMSINSTAL does not display, print or
   copy the release notes; typically, this option is selected
   when the user wants to terminate the installation.

                                NOTE

       This version of the release notes file installed by
       VMSINSTAL is labeled with the current product name and
       version number. Take care not to delete release notes
       for previous versions of VAX APL.

   Next, VMSINSTAL displays the following prompt:

     * Do you want to continue the installation [N]?: Y <Return>

   If you want to continue the installation, type Y and press
   <Return>. If you press <Return>, VMSINSTAL discontinues the
   installation.

   In either case, VMSINSTAL moves the release notes to
   SYS$HELP.

   Step 5: Respond to License Registration Queries.

   VAX APL supports the VMS License Management Facility (LMF).
   The installation procedure displays license information about
   your product and then asks if you have registered and loaded
   your authorization key for VAX APL. The following example
   shows that information:

                                   VAX APL Installation Guide 11

 






             Product:      APL
             Producer:     DEC
             Version:      3.2
             Release Date: 26-FEB-1990

     * Does this product have an authorization key registered and
       loaded? YES <Return>

   Type YES and press <Return> if you have registered and loaded
   your authorization key.

   If you have not registered and loaded your authorization key,
   you must answer "NO" to this question. You have to register
   and load your product authorization key to successfully
   complete the installation. If you have not done so, you
   should stop the installation, register and load your product
   authorization key, and then restart the installation,
   beginning with Step 2.

   During the installation procedure, the VAX APL LMF key is
   invoked.

   Step 6: Select installation options.

           This kit contains an Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)
           to verify the correct installation of the VAX APL interpreter.
           It can be run prior to the conclusion of this procedure by
           answering "YES" to the IVP prompt or invoked after the
           installation as follows:

           $ APL/TERM=TTY/SILENT SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.APL]APL$IVP

     * Do you want to run the IVP after the installation [YES]? <Return>

   The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) runs tests
   to check whether the installation procedure was successful.
   Press <Return> to run the IVP after the installation. If you
   do not want to run the IVP, enter NO and press <Return> in
   response to the prompt.

     * Do you want VMS Workstation Software (VWS) fonts [NO]? YES <Return>

12  VAX APL Installation Guide

 






   The VMS Workstation Software fonts are optionally available
   for installation. The workstation fonts are needed to support
   APL character display on VAXstations running VMS Workstation
   Software V4.1. Enter NO and press <Return> if you do not want
   to install the VMS Workstation Software fonts. Enter YES and
   press <Return> if you want to install the VMS Workstation
   Software fonts.

      Under Version 2.0 of DECwindows, this version of VAX APL can display
      the APL characters in the DECwindows terminal.  To do this, the APL
      fonts must be installed on the DECwindows server.

  The SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB and SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE files
   are updated to include the new versions of the VAX APL HELP
   text and the APL command line definition.

   The UIS$LOAD_FONT_APL.COM and DVWS*.VWS$*FONT files will be
   put into SYSFONT if it exists. If SYSFONT does not exist,
   they will be put in SYS$LIBRARY.

   A sample startup command procedure, APL$STARTUP.COM is put
   in SYS$STARTUP. This procedure is also used to insure that
   APLSHR.EXE is correctly installed before running the IVP.

   The success of the installation is indicated by the following
   message:

     %VMSINSTAL-I-MOVEFILES, Files will now be moved to their target
     directories...

   If the installation procedure is successful, the new or
   modified files are moved to their target directories.

   If you typed YES in response to the prompt that requests a
   file purge at Step 6, previous versions of the VAX APL files
   are now purged.

   Step 8: Observe the Installation Verification Procedure.

   If you chose to run the IVP in Step 6, VMSINSTAL now calls
   the IVP to verify that VAX APL was installed successfully.

   If the IVP was successful, the following messages appear on
   the screen:

        Beginning the VAX APL V3.2 Installation Verification Procedure.

        VAX APL V3.2 Installation Verification Procedure completed
        successfully.

        Installation of APL V3.2 completed at hh:mm

18  VAX APL Installation Guide

 






   If the installation procedure fails for any reason, the
   following message is displayed:

        VAX APL V3.2 Installation Verification Procedure failed.

   Step 9: End the installation procedure.

        VMSINSTAL procedure done at hh:mm

     $ LOGOUT <Return>
     SYSTEM     logged out at dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss.ss

   When the product installation procedure is complete, you
   can choose to install more products or to log out (as shown
   here). If you removed any media from the console drive before
   beginning the installation, you should replace it now.

   VMSINSTAL deletes or changes entries in the process symbol
   tables during the installation. Therefore, if you are going
   to continue using the system manager's account and you want
   to restore these symbols, you should log out and log in
   again.

__________________________________________________________

Installing VAX APL on a VAXcluster

   If you want to run VAX APL on multiple nodes of a VAXcluster,
   first check to see that you have the appropriate software
   license. Then, follow these steps after installing VAX APL:

    1.Issue the LICENSE LOAD command to activate the license
      on each node in the VAXcluster on which VAX APL is to
      be executed as described in the VMS License Management
      Utility Manual.

    2.Run SYS$STARTUP:APL$STARTUP.COM on each node of the
      cluster that has a software license.

        $ @SYS$STARTUP:APL$STARTUP <Return>

                                   VAX APL Installation Guide 19

 






    3.If APL character support for Digital VT200 series
      terminals, Digital VT300 series terminals, and VAXstations
      is wanted, run SYS$MANAGER:PCLOADER.COM on each node of
      the cluster.

        $ @SYS$MANAGER:PCLOADER <Return>

    4.To use the product on other nodes in the VAXcluster,
      you must replace the version of the DCL tables that is
      installed on the other VAXcluster nodes. To do this,
      perform the following steps:

       a.Log in to a node on the cluster.

       b.Run INSTALL and enter the following command at the
         INSTALL> prompt:

           INSTALL> REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE <Return>

       c.Repeat Steps a and b for each node of the cluster.

__________________________________________________________

Installing VAX APL on a VAXstation

   If you want to run VAX APL on a VAXstation, first check that
   you have the appropriate software license. Then, follow the
   instructions in the Installing VAX APL section.

                                NOTE

       If you are using a VAXstation and accessing a host VAX
       system to run VAX APL, VAX APL must be installed on
       both the host VAX system and the VAXstation.

   For installations on a VAXstation running DECwindows, skip to
   the After the Installation section. (The rest of this section
   contains information needed for installations on VAXstations
   running VMS Workstation Software.)

   If you are installing VAX APL on a VAXstation running VMS
   Workstation Software, follow the steps below after installing
   VAX APL as explained in the Installing VAX APL section.

20  VAX APL Installation Guide

 






   UIS$VT_ENABLE_OSC_STRINGS Logical

   The system logical name UIS$VT_ENABLE_OSC_STRINGS must
   be defined as "TRUE" to enable VAX APL to support the APL
   character set and keyboard on the VAXstation. If the system
   logical name is not defined as "TRUE", characters will
   display in ASCII as if APL support had not been enabled.

   Use the SHOW command to determine if the logical is defined
   as "TRUE" by entering the following command:

     $ SHOW LOGICAL UIS$VT* <Return>

   If the logical is defined as "TRUE," skip to the APL
   Character Font Files section. If the system message indicates
   that the logical is not defined or is not defined to be
   "TRUE," then follow the steps below.

    1.Define the system logical name UIS$VT_ENABLE_OSC_STRINGS
      to be "TRUE" by entering the following command:

        $ DEFINE/SYSTEM/EXEC UIS$VT_ENABLE_OSC_STRINGS TRUE <RETURN>

    2.Edit SYS$MANAGER:UIS$SETUP_VT240.COM to add the system
      logical name defined above. This will ensure that when
      the system is rebooted, the system logical name will be
      defined as "TRUE."

                                NOTE

       This logical enables many facilities in the VAXstation
       terminal emulator and only affects terminal windows
       created after its value is defined.

   APL Character Font Files

   If you entered "YES" in response to the VMS Workstation
   Software fonts question in Step 6 of the Installing VAX APL
   section, the following files are placed on the VAXstation.
   The files that contain the APL character fonts are placed in
   SYS$FONT if it exists; otherwise in SYS$LIBRARY.

                                   VAX APL Installation Guide 21

 






    o UIS$LOAD_FONT_APL.COM is placed in SYS$FONT. This file
      loads the APL fonts into font memory at system startup.

    o DVWSVT0I03WK00GG001TKZZZZ02A000.VWS$FONT the VAXstation
      APL 80-wide normal font

    o DVWSVT0G03CK00GG001TKZZZZ02A000.VWS$FONT the VAXstation
      APL 132-wide normal font

    o DVWSVT0I03WK00GG001TKZZZZ02A000.VWS$VAFONT the GPX APL
      80-wide normal font

    o DVWSVT0G03CK00GG001TKZZZZ02A000.VWS$VAFONT the GPX APL
      132-wide normal font

   UIS$VT_SPACING and UIS$VT_POINT Logicals

   The VT200 terminal emulator allows the user to select
   different fonts based on character size by defining the
   UIS$VT_SPACING and UIS$VT_POINT logicals.

   If these logicals are not defined with the default settings,
   then the VT220 terminal emulator will use an MCS font
   corresponding to the size specified by the user. The user
   will see the APL keyboard, but will not see the APL font.

   Verify with the following command, that the logicals are
   defined with the default settings shown below:

     $ SHOW LOGICAL UIS$VT_* <Return>

   _____________________________________________________________
   Logical_______________Default_Setting________________________

   UIS$VT_SPACING_DEF     9

   UIS$VT_SPACING_132     7

   UIS$VT_SPACING_80      9

   UIS$VT_POINT_DEF      14

   UIS$VT_POINT_132      12

   UIS$VT_POINT_80_______14_____________________________________

22  VAX APL Installation Guide








   If the logical names are not defined to the default settings,
   edit SYS$MANAGER:UIS$SETUP_VT240.COM to change the logical
   settings. Execute the command file with the following
   command:

     $ @SYS$MANAGER:UIS$SETUP_VT240 <Return>

__________________________________________________________

After the Installation

   VAX APL is now installed and can be invoked by all users with
   the APL command.

   The installation procedure modifies the DCL command table so
   that the APL command is recognized and processed. However,
   the previous command table is still in effect for those users
   who are currently logged in. All logged-in users who want
   to use the APL command must log out of the system and log in
   again.

   If VAX APL is used extensively on your system, you can reduce
   system overhead and memory requirements by installing it
   as a shared image using the VMS Install Utility. For more
   information, see the Installing VAX APL As a Shared Image
   section.

__________________________________________________________

PCDRIVER, The Terminal Driver Software

   PCDRIVER supports the APL character set on Digital VT200
   series terminals, Digital VT300 series terminals, and
   VAXstations. If it is not already installed, PCDRIVER, the
   terminal driver software, is installed automatically by the
   VAX APL installation.

                                   VAX APL Installation Guide 23

 





   Verify that PCDRIVER is running by entering the following
   command:

     $ SHOW DEVICE PC <Return>

   If VMS reports NO SUCH DEVICE, follow the steps below to
   start the PCDRIVER.

    1.PCDRIVER.EXE is not a shareable image. Use the following
      command to make sure that the file was installed with the
      /NOSHARED qualifier:

        $ INSTALL LIST/SUMMARY SYS$LOADABLE_IMAGES:PCDRIVER <Return>

      If the PCDRIVER.EXE file is not installed as a shareable
      image, go to Step 2. If the PCDRIVER.EXE file is installed
      as a shared image, use the following command to change the
      installation:

        $ INSTALL REPLACE/NOSHARE SYS$LOADABLE_IMAGES:PCDRIVER <Return>

    2.Start the PCDRIVER by typing the following command:

        $ @SYS$LIBRARY:PCLOADER <Return>

    3.SYS$LIBRARY:PCLOADER should be invoked from
      the site-specific system startup procedure,
      SYS$STARTUP:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM. Edit the startup command
      procedure to add the following command:

        $ @SYS$LIBRARY:PCLOADER

__________________________________________________________

Control Character Keywords

   A feature of VMS V4.0 and subsequent releases is that
   keywords can be displayed when certain control characters
   are typed. By default, the following keywords are displayed
   for the control characters listed:

24  VAX APL Installation Guide








   _____________________________________________________________
   Control
   Character___Keyword__________________________________________

   CTRL/Y      Interrupt

   CTRL/C      Cancel

   CTRL/Z______Exit_____________________________________________

   These keywords are enabled on a system-wide basis. VMS
   displays keywords even if the terminal is not in the ASCII
   character set. A site that uses VT102 terminals for APL may
   wish to modify these keywords so that they display correctly
   on both ASCII and APL terminals.

   The easiest way to accomplish this is to use keywords
   entirely in lowercase letters. They will display as lowercase
   letters on an ASCII terminal and as APL letters on a key- or
   bit-paired APL terminal.

   See the VMS System Generation Utility Manual for more
   information.

   To modify the keywords to CTRL/Y, CTRL/C, and so on, edit
   the file SYS$EXAMPLES:SYSGTTSTR.MSG. The file contains
   instructions for the editing procedure and to activate the
   new definitions.

__________________________________________________________

Modifiable Files

   Certain files may be modified after installation if desired.

    o VAXAPL.HLP, the source text of the VAX APL HELP function

Moving the QAPL Application

   QAPL.EXE, the execute-only, runtime support for APL
   applications, is installed on SYS$SYSTEM. This support
   facility can be used to execute APL applications but cannot
   be used to develop APL applications. It may be moved to any
   valid VAX/VMS system, free of charge, whether the system is
   licensed for VAX APL or not.

   To move the execute-only, runtime APL to a VMS system where
   it does not exist, follow these instructions:

    1.Copy the following files from the VMS system on which they
      are installed to the target system area specified.

       o QAPL.EXE to SYS$SYSTEM:

       o APLMSG.EXE to SYS$MESSAGE:

       o APLSYS.OBJ to SYS$LIBRARY:

       o APLDISP.OBJ to SYS$LIBRARY:

       o PCLOADER.COM to SYS$LIBRARY:

       o APL$VT220_FONT.FNT to SYS$LIBRARY:

       o APL$VT240_FONT.FNT to SYS$LIBRARY:

       o APL$VT240_FONT_132.FNT to SYS$LIBRARY:

       o APL$VT320_FONT.FNT to SYS$LIBRARY:

       o APL$VT320_FONT_132.FNT to SYS$LIBRARY:

       o APL$VT330_FONT.FNT to SYS$LIBRARY:

       o APL$VT330_FONT_132.FNT to SYS$LIBRARY:

       o APL$VT340_FONT.FNT to SYS$LIBRARY:

       o APL$VT340_FONT_132.FNT to SYS$LIBRARY:

       o APL.CLD to SYS$LIBRARY:

       o VAXAPL.HLB (optional) to SYS$HELP:

26  VAX APL Installation Guide

 





      If PCDRIVER is not available on the target system, then,
      copy the following to files:

       o PCDRIVER.OBJ to SYS$LIBRARY:

       o PCDRIVER.EXE to SYS$LOADABLE_IMAGES:

    2.Edit and execute a command file to facilitate linking the
      QAPL object modules into a program image as shown in this
      example:

        $ EDIT LINK_QAPL.COM <Return>
        $LINK/PROTECT/NOSYSSHR/NODEBUG/NOMAP/NOTRACE/- <Return>
        $_SHARE=SYS$LIBRARY:APLSHR.EXE SYS$LIBRARY:APLSYS.OBJ,- <Return>
        $_SYS$INPUT/OPTIONS,SYS$SYSTEM:SYS.STB/SELECTIVE <Return>
        CLUSTER=TRANSFER_VECTOR,,,SYS$LIBRARY:APLDISP.OBJ <Return>
        GSMATCH=LEQUAL,1,1 <Return>
        CTRL/Z

        $ @LINK_QAPL <Return>

    3.If the PCDRIVER is not available on the QAPL system,
      edit and execute a command file to facilitate linking
      the PCDRIVER object module into a program image as shown
      in this example:

        $ EDIT LINK_PCDRIVER.COM <Return>
        $LINK/NODEBUG/NOMAP/NOTRACEBACK/- <Return>
        $_EXE=SYS$LOADABLE_IMAGES:PCDRIVER.EXE- <Return>
        $_ SYS$LIBRARY:PCDRIVER.OBJ,- <Return>
        $_SYS$INPUT/OPTIONS,SYS$SYSTEM:SYS.STB <Return>
        BASE=0 <Return>
        IDENT="APL V3.2" <Return>
        CTRL/Z

        $ @LINK_PCDRIVER <Return>

    4.Use the following DCL command to install the APL command
      on the target system (you must have SYSPRV privileges to
      change the DCL command table):

        $ SET COMMAND/TABLE=SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES/- <Return>
        $_OUTPUT=SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES APL.CLD <Return>

                                   VAX APL Installation Guide 27

 






    5.Use the INSTALL utility to replace the system's DCLTABLES.
      Users that log in after the DCLTABLES have been replaced
      will be able to access the APL command.

        $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:INSTALL <Return>

        INSTALL> REPLACE SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE <Return>

__________________________________________________________

Running the Installation Verification Procedure Separately

   The Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) is usually
   run at installation. The IVP (Installation Verification
   Procedure) files, APL$IVP.APL and APL$IVPKIT.COM are put
   in SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.APL] so that the IVP may be run after
   the installation is completed.

   If you want to run the IVP separately to ensure the integrity
   of installed files if system problems occur, execute the
   following command procedure:

     $ APL/TERM=TTY/SILENT SYS$COMMON:[SYSTEST.APL]APL$IVP  <Return>

__________________________________________________________

Error Conditions

   If the installation procedure fails for any reason, a message
   like the following one is displayed:

     %VMSINSTAL-E-INSFAIL, The installation of VAX APL
     Version 3.2 has failed.

28  VAX APL Installation Guide

 






   An error during the installation can occur if one or more of
   the following conditions exist:

    o Operating system version is incorrect.

    o Quotas necessary for successful installation are
      insufficient (see the Installation Procedure Requirements
      section).

    o Process quotas required by VMSINSTAL are incorrect (see
      the Using VMSINSTAL section).

    o The VMS HELP library is currently in use.

    o The product was registered incorrectly or not registered.

   For descriptions of the error messages generated by these
   conditions, see the VMS System Messages and Recovery
   Procedures Reference Volume, your processor-specific
   installation/operations guide, or the VMS License Management
   Utility Manual.

   If you are notified that any of these conditions exists, take
   the appropriate action as described in the message. You may
   need to change a system parameter or increase an authorized
   quota value.

   If the installation fails, you must restart the installation
   procedure from Step 2. If the installation fails due
   to an IVP failure, contact a Digital customer services
   representative.

__________________________________________________________

Installing VAX APL As a Shared Image

   If VAX APL will be used extensively on your system, you
   can reduce the system overhead and memory requirements
   by installing VAX APL as a shared image. To perform the
   installation on a system that is currently running, use the
   VMS Install Utility while you are logged in to a privileged
   account. If errors occur, see the VMS System Messages and
   Recovery Procedures Reference Volume.

                                   VAX APL Installation Guide 29

 






   First, determine the number of available global pages
   and global sections on your system. See the Installation
   Procedure Requirements section for information on how to do
   this.

   Then, invoke the VMS Install Utility and install VAX APL as a
   shared image by typing the following commands.

                                NOTE

       APLSHR.EXE must be installed as a protected, shareable
       image. APL.EXE, QAPL.EXE and APLMSG.EXE installations
       are optional.

     $ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:INSTALL <Return>

     INSTALL> ADD SYS$LIBRARY:APLSHR.EXE/OPEN/SHARED/HEADER/PROT <Return>
     INSTALL> ADD SYS$SYSTEM:APL.EXE/OPEN/SHARED/HEADER_RESIDENT <Return>
     INSTALL> ADD SYS$SYSTEM:QAPL.EXE/OPEN/SHARED/HEADER_RESIDENT <Return>
     INSTALL> ADD SYS$MESSAGE:APLMSG.EXE/OPEN/SHARED <Return>
     INSTALL> EXIT <Return>

   To ensure that VAX APL is installed as a shared image each
   time the system is bootstrapped, include the following lines
   in SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_V5.COM (the site-specific startup
   file):

     $INSTALL
     ADD SYS$LIBRARY:APLSHR.EXE/OPEN/SHARED/HEADER_/PROT <Return>
     ADD SYS$SYSTEM:APL.EXE/OPEN/SHARED/HEADER_RESIDENT <Return>
     ADD SYS$SYSTEM:QAPL.EXE/OPEN/SHARED/HEADER_RESIDENT <Return>
     ADD SYS$MESSAGE:APLMSG.EXE/OPEN/SHARED <Return>
     EXIT <Return>

                                NOTE

       APLSHR.EXE must be installed as a protected, shareable
       image. APL.EXE, QAPL.EXE and APLMSG.EXE installations
       are optional.

Maintenance Updates

   Digital may periodically issue maintenance updates of VAX
   APL. Each update consists of an installation kit. You should
   install this kit as described in this document or in any
   documentation that may accompany the maintenance update.

   Each time a maintenance update is released, the version
   number changes. For example, if the current version is 1.0,
   the version number of the first maintenance update will
   be 1.1. In addition, each maintenance update includes new
   release notes. The release notes describe the changes that
   have been made to VAX APL since the previous release.

   The updated release notes are provided on line. You should
   read the release notes when you first install VAX APL;
   they are also accessible at any time after the product is
   installed. For information on reading the release notes at
   the time that you install VAX APL, follow the installation
   procedure through Step 5. To locate the release notes

   after VAX APL is installed, display or print the file
   SYS$HELP:APL032.RELEASE_NOTES or type the following command:

     $ HELP APL RELEASE_NOTES <Return>

__________________________________________________________

Determining and Reporting Problems

   If an error occurs while you are using VAX APL and you
   believe that the error is caused by a problem with VAX APL,
   take one of the following actions:

    o If you purchased VAX APL within the past 90 days and you
      think the problem is caused by a software error, you can
      submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).

                                   VAX APL Installation Guide 31

 






    o If you have a Basic or DECsupport Software Agreement,
      you should call your Customer Support Center. With these
      services, you receive telephone support that provides
      high-level advisory and remedial assistance. For more
      information, contact your local Digital customer services
      representative.

    o If you have a Self-Maintenance Software Agreement, you can
      submit a Software Performance Report (SPR).

   If you find an error in the VAX APL documentation, you should
   fill out and submit a Reader's Comments form from the back
   of the document in which the error was found. Include the
   section and page number where the error was found.

      addition, be sure to have your system manager add
      @SYS$STARTUP:APL$STARTUP.COM to your system startup file.

      If you intend to use DECterm or the VT200, VT300, or HDS200
