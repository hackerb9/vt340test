Processors not Supported 

MicroVAX I, VAXstation I, VAX-11/725, VAXstation 8000 

Processor Restrictions 

A TK50 Tape Drive is required for standalone MicroVAX 2000 and VAXstation 
2000 systems.

The VAX-11/782 processor is not supported by VMS Operating System V5.0 or 
later.
 
Block space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1):

Disk space required for installation:			    7,000 blocks 
							    (3584K bytes)

Disk space required for use (permanent):
						    5,000 - 5,300 blocks 
						  (2,560K - 2,714K bytes)

These block counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk.  
The sizes are approximations; actual sizes may vary depending on the 
user's system environment, configuration and software options selected.
 
Memory Requirements for DECwindows Support

The minimum supported memory for this application running in a standalone 
DECwindows environment with both the client and server executing on the 
same system is 10 MB.

The minimum memory support is 10 MB.  However, the use of this software 
in conjunction with increased memory capability improves performance 
especially where large data arrays are being processed.  The memory size 
suggested for most typical hardware configurations is at least 16 MB.

OPTIONAL HARDWARE

Floating point intensive applications should be run on configurations 
with the appropriate hardware support for the floating point data types 
being used. Consult the Base Operating System SPD for the Floating Point 
Accelerator or other floating point hardware appropriate for your 
configuration. 

Terminal Support 

VAX APL supports the APL character set on the following terminals:

^ VT320

^ VT330

^ VT340

^ VT220

^ VT240

^ VAXstation

VAXCLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

This layered product is fully supported when installed on any valid and 
licensed VAXcluster* configuration without restrictions.  The HARDWARE  
REQUIREMENTS sections of this product's Software Product Description and 
System Support Addendum detail any special hardware required by this 
product.

* V5.x VAXcluster configurations are fully described in the VAXcluster 
  Software Product Description (29.78.xx) and include CI, Ethernet and 
  Mixed Interconnect configurations.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS 

For Systems Using Terminals (No DECwindows Interface):

^ VMS Operating System  V5.2

For Workstations Running VWS:

^ VMS Operating System  V5.2

^ VMS Workstation Software  V4.1

For Workstations Running DECwindows:

^ VMS Operating System V5.3 (and necessary components of VMS DECwindows)

This product may run in either of the following ways;

Stand-alone execution - running the X11 display server and the client 
application on the same machine.

Remote execution - running the X11 display server and the client 
application on different machines.

VMS DECwindows is part of the VMS Operating System but must be installed 
separately.  Installation of VMS DECwindows gives you the option to 
install any or all of the following three component:

VMS DECwindows Compute Server (Base kit; includes runtime support)

VMS DECwindows Device Support

VMS DECwindows Programming Support

For stand-alone execution, the following DECwindows components must be 
installed on the machine:
									 
^ VMS DECwindows Compute Server

^ VMS DECwindows Device Support

For remote execution, the following DECwindows components must be 
installed on the machine:

Server Machine

^ VMS DECwindows Compute Server

^ VMS DECwindows Device Support

Client Machine

^ VMS DECwindows Compute Server

VMS Tailoring

For VMS V5.x systems, the following VMS classes are required for full 
functionality of this layered product:

^ VMS Required Saveset

^ Programming Support

^ System Programming Support

^ Utilities

For more information on VMS classes and tailoring, refer to the VMS 
Operating System Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx).

OPTIONAL SOFTWARE

None

GROWTH CONSIDERATIONS

The minimum hardware/software requirements for any future version of this 
product may be different from the minimum hardware requirements of the 
current version.
