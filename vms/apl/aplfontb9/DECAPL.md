# DECAPL Character Set

This is the character set which is embedded in the fonts which DEC
included with APL for the VAX. Note that I have put the hex values
starting at A0 instead of 20 because the font files load themselves
into G1, which is Graphic Right by default on the VT340, and would
thus be accessible by bytes with the eighth bit high.
