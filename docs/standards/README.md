# Relevant standards

Some of DEC's documentation doesn't make much sense until you see the
standards they were constrained by. 

## ANSI X3.64-1979: The ANSI Standard for Escape Sequences

* [ANSI-X3.64-1979.pdf](ANSI-X3.64-1979.pdf)

This standard was so ubiquitous in the 1980s that even now, forty
years later, the phrase "ANSI" in computer circles often implies this
document that describes how valid escape sequences can be formed,
defines the meaning for some, and reserves space for private extensions.


## ISO 2022-1973: Multilingual code extension techniques.

This is the standard that explains how to shift out to replace the
character sets G0 and G1 character sets with characters from other
languages. 

Technically identical to ECMA-35, ANSI X3.41-1974, and FIPS Pub 35.

## ISO 646-1973

Technically identical to ECMA-6 and CCITT Rec V.3 (Alphabet 5).

## ANSI X3.41-1974

Technically identical to FIPS Pub 1-1
