# Relevant standards

Some of DEC's documentation doesn't make much sense until you see the
standards they were constrained by. 

## The ANSI Standard for Escape Sequences

* [ANSI-X3.64-1979.pdf](ANSI-X3.64-1979.pdf) - Original document
* [ECMA-48_Jun91.pdf](ECMA-48_Jun91.pdf) - Final version
* Equivalent to ISO 6429

This standard was so ubiquitous in the 1980s that even now, decades
later, the phrase "ANSI" in computer circles often implies this
document that describes how valid escape sequences can be formed,
defines the meaning for some sequences, and specifies how private
extensions can be made.


## ISO 2022-1973: Multilingual code extension techniques.

This is the standard that explains how to shift out to replace the
character sets G0 and G1 character sets with characters from other
languages. 

Technically identical to ECMA-35, ANSI X3.41-1974, and FIPS Pub 35.

## ASCII 

* ISO 646-1973 - Original international standardization,
* Technically identical to ECMA-6 and CCITT Rec V.3 (Alphabet 5).

## ANSI X3.41-1974

* Technically identical to FIPS Pub 1-1
