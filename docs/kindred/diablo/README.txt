## Distinguishing typefaces

The characters which make Diablo Courier 72 distinct from other
"Courier" fonts are `G`, `r`, `i`, `d`, `L`, `I`, `1`, and `·`.
Perhaps most notable are the extremely large dots used for bullet
points, ·. Look for the base of the 'i' being not too wide and its dot
above being rounded, not square. The serif at the top the 'd' should
be rather prominent. The serif on the G should stick in much further
than it sticks out. The base of the I and r should not be wide.

[ Examples go here ]


* TeX Gyre Cursor Bold is perhaps the closest font because it has
  rounded the edges and dots. However, the dots are too small, the 'i'
  is too wide, the stem of the lowercase 'd' is too tall and its serif
  too short.

* Apple's Courier (based on Bitstream) is also quite close. The center
  dot is bigger than in Cursor, which is good, but it is still not big
  enough. The serif on the 'G' sticks out too far. Both capital and
  lowercase 'i' are too wide. The base and stem serif of the lowercase
  'r' extend out too far to the left. The serif on the tail of the q
  is too wide, especially to the left. The dot over the i is a square
  when it should be round.

* IBM's original Courier has the same problems as Apple's Courier.
  Plus, the original typeface appears to have had no center dot. (???)
  That makes me wonder how DEC was drawing bullet points in their
  documentation.

* IBM's Courier New, by Adrian Frutiger for the IBM Selectric, has
  similar problems to the Apple's Courier. An additional problem is
  that the serif on the d's stem is now much too short. Also, the font
  itself is lighter when DEC's courier should be heavier. There are
  some things which make Courier New more like DEC's courier: serif at
  base of lowercase m's left leg sticks out to the left and right; the
  period and comma have been enlarged; the exclamation mark now tapers
  correctly.

* Nimbus Monospace is identical to Courier New

* Courier Prime has some similarities to DEC's courier in that it is
  heavier and the corners are rounded, but too many other letterforms
  seem off. For example, the tail of the y tapers off without a serif.
  Once a DEC documents is OCR'd it might be a nice font to use to
  re-render in the text the PDF. 


* Courier Twelve: very close. I, i are too wide, same with serif on q.
  Good: Top of M is angled inward. Serif on d is long enough.

* Courier 10 Pitch: 'd' is wrong, but letters are darker and dot on i
  is rounded.

* Courier SB: Has a good look to it, very thick lines for bold, but
  symbols are off. Apostrophe is too light as are period and comma. At
  sign is too wide and just wrong, like it's from a different font.
  Line in dollar sign pierces S. Caret is too large. Serifs on q and r
  are too wide. i stem should be thicker and serifs narrower. SB Does
  have a nice thick bullet, •, at U+2022. Maybe I should have been
  looking at that instead of middle dot, ·. Has nicely rounded dot
  over the i, but perhaps it is too blobby and not circular enough.
