1.2 Physical Description

   The peripheral repeater is shown in Figure 1-3.
   The two major components are the enclosure and the
   internal assembly.

   The plastic enclosure is open on the bottom and
   rear. It is designed to be placed beneath a VR290
   color monitor. With the internal assembly installed
   or removed, the enclosure will support the weight

   switch and power LED indicator are mounted on the
   internal assembly and project through holes in the
   front of the enclosure.

   With the exception of the plastic enclosure, all of
   the peripheral repeater components are mounted on
   or in the internal assembly. The internal assembly
   is basically a 6-sided metal box.

   The top of the box is extended on the left and
   right edges to form flanges which ride in tracks
   on the plastic enclosure. The rear edge of the top
   is turned down to form a handle for removing the
   internal assembly from the enclosure.

   The major components contained within the internal
   assembly are shown in Figure 1-4, and include:

   The back panel components, identified in Figure 1-5,
   are mounted on the peripheral repeater printed cir-
   cuit board and project through holes in the back
   panel of the internal assembly chassis. These com-
   ponents include the interactive device connectors,
   Function LED, and diagnostic LEDs. The ac power
   connectors, which also project through the back
   panel, are not mounted on the peripheral repeater
   printed circuit board.

1.2.1 Jumpers

   There are two jumpers in the peripheral repeater
   and both are factory set.

    1. Power Supply Jumper. The jumper on the power
      supply board selects either 120 Vac (labeled
      115V on the board) or 240 Vac (labeled 230V on
      the board) operation.

    2. External Address Jumper. The jumper on the
      peripheral repeater board is the external
      address jumper for the 8031 microprocessor. This
      jumper must be in place.

1.2.2 Connectors

   Table 1-1 describes the various connectors and
   connections in the peripheral repeater.

   The peripheral repeater is a free-running subsys-
   tem. It performs self-test at power up to check its
   internal status. Following successful completion of
   self-test, the peripheral repeater initializes it-
   self and starts a continuous scan for activity from
   the KA800 or interactive devices.

   The functional hardware components of the periph-
   eral repeater are contained on the peripheral re-
   peater printed-circuit board, or PRB, and the H7820
   power supply printed-circuit board. The operational
   and diagnostic firmware are contained in 8 kbytes
   of ROM (read-only memory) on the PRB.


2.2 Peripheral Repeater Board

   Figure 2-1 is a block diagram of the peripheral
   repeater printed-circuit board. The blocks are
   described in the following subsections.

2.2.1 8031 Microprocessor

   The 8031 microprocessor (Figure 2-2) is an 8-
   bit microprocessor that includes the following
   features:

    _
      32 I/O lines (four 8-bit ports)
    _

    _
      128-byte internal data memory
    _

    _
      64-kbyte external data memory address space
    _

    _
      64-kbyte external program memory address space
    _
      (no internal program memory.)

    _
      Two 16-bit timer/counters
    _

    _
      A 5-source/2-level interrupt structure
    _

   The peripheral repeater program memory and external
   data memory occupy only the lowest 24 kbytes of the
   128-kbyte external memory address space. Program
   memory is contained in an 8-kbyte ROM (read-only
   memory). External data memory is contained in two
   8-kbyte SRAMs (static random-access memories).

2.2.2 Address Space

   The 8031 microprocessor has separate address spaces
   for program memory and data memory. Program memory
   is entirely external to the 8031, while data memory
   comprises both external memory and on-chip, or
   internal, memory. The 16-bit address allows both
   program memory and external data memory to occupy
   up to 64 kbytes of address space. The appropriate
   address space is selected by using PSEN as the
   read strobe for program memory, and RD and WR as
   the data strobes for external data memory. Note
   that the peripheral repeater uses only 32 kbytes
   of address space and that program and external
   data memory occupy uniquely addressed segments. See
   Table 2-2.

2.2.2.1 I/O Registers

   The I/O Registers space, also called the I/O Page
   or Bank 7, is part of external data memory and
   is allocated as shown in Table 2-3. This space
   is selected when ADDR 15:13 are asserted, causing
   signal SEL BNK 7 (Figure 2-4 and Table 2-6) to be
   asserted. When SEL BNK 7 is asserted, note that:

    _
      ADDR 12 is asserted, ADDR 11 is deasserted, and
    _
      ADDR <10:00> are ignored when the Diagnostic
      Register is addressed.

    _
      ADDR 12 is deasserted, ADDR 11 is asserted, and
    _
      ADDR <10:00> are ignored when the Diagnostic
      Register is addressed.

    _
      ADDR <11:12> are deasserted and ADDR <10:08> and
    _
      ADDR 06 are ignored when the DC349 registers are
      addressed.

      In addition, if ADDR 02 is set, ADDR <05:03>
      (the channel number bits) are also ignored and
      either the DC349 Interrupt Summary Register
      or DC349 Data Set Change Summary Register is
      addressed.

    _
      ADDR 07 is deasserted to write the writable

      DC349 registers. Therefore, addresses in the
      range E0BD_₁₆through E080_₁₆are read addresses,
      and addresses in the range E03B_₁₆through
      E000_₁₆are write addresses. Read/modify/write
      instructions should not be used to access these
      registers.

    _
      DC349 Mode Registers 1 and 2 have the same ad-
    _
      dress and are accessed by sequential opera-
      tions (read/read, read/write, write/read, or
      write/write) to that address. The first oper-
      ation accesses Mode Register 1, the next Mode
      Register 2, the next Mode Register 1, and so
      on. Reading the Command Register resets the
      sequential counter to point to Mode Register 1.

2.2.3 Address Latch

   The lowest eight bits of address and data are mul-
   tiplexed on lines AD<7:0>, as shown in Figure 2-1.
   When an address is on these lines, signal ALE is
   asserted by the 8031, and the address is latched
   in the ADDR LTCH (Address Latch). The output of the
   ADDR LTCH is ADDR<7:0>.

2.2.4 Data Transceivers

   The DATA XCVR (Data Transceivers), Figure 2-1,
   determine the direction of data transferred between
   the DATA<7:0> lines and the multiplexed address and
   data AD<7:0> lines. When the 8031 asserts BUS READ
   through the CTRL BFFR DCDR, data is transferred to
   the 8031; when BUS READ is not asserted, data is
   transferred from the 8031.

2.2.5 Control Buffer/Decoder

   The CTRL BFFR DCDR (control buffer/decoder) is
   shown in Figure 2-3. Its input and output signals
   are described in Table 2-5.

   or write/write) to the same address. The first op-
   eration accesses Mode Register 1, the next Mode
   Register 2, the next Mode Register 1, and so on.

   The register formats are described in the following
   subsections.

2.2.8.1 DC349 Receiver Buffer and Transmitter Holding
        Register

   The Receiver Buffer (Figure 2-7) and Transmitter
   Holding Register (Figure 2-8) occupy the same
   address space on the chip; however, receiver (read)
   and transmitter (write) addresses are different
   because ADDR 07 controls the read/write function.
   The Receiver Buffer comprises a 2-entry FIFO and
   a character assembly register. The Transmitter
   Holding Register comprises a 2-entry FIFO and a
   serialization register. Receiver Buffer bits are
   described in Table 2-8, and Transmitter Holding
   Register bits are described in Table 2-9.

2.2.8.8 DC349 Interrupts

   The IRQ output of the DC349 is controlled by an
   interrupt scanner, which sequentially checks
   channels 0 through 7 for a receiver interrupt
   condition, then checks channels 0 through 7 for
   a transmitter interrupt condition. If stopped for a
   receiver interrupt condition, the scanner resumes
   the sequential scan from the point at which it was
   stopped. If stopped for a transmitter interrupt
   condition, the scanner restarts the scan with
   receiver channel 0. Any interrupt must be serviced
   before subsequent interrupts can be posted.





2-38  Functional Description









   Three conditions can cause an interrupt:

    _
      A channel's receive buffer is full and receive
    _
      interrupts are enabled for that channel (RXIE is
      set).

    _
      A transition occurs on a channel's carrier
    _
      detect line (DCD) and modem control interrupts
      are enabled for that channel (MCIE is set).

    _
      A channel's transmitter holding register is
    _
      empty and transmit interrupts are enabled for
      that channel (TXIE is set).

2.2.9 Interactive Device Receivers and Transmitters

   As shown in Figure 2-6, serial data is transferred
   between the DC349 OCTALART and the interactive
   devices through eight drivers (DRVR) and eight
   receivers (RCVR). The drivers and receivers provide
   the TTL signal levels required by the DC349 and
   the RS232/RS422 signal levels required by the
   interactive devices.

   Each receiver and driver is connected to an ESD/EOS
   (electrostatic discharge and electrical overstress)
   protection circuit. Each of these circuits consists
   of a bidirectional zener diode and a resistor.

   In addition, inverters (INVT) are connected between
   the device present lines from the applicable
   devices and the DC349 carrier detect pins on the
   following ports:


   Port
                     1      2      3      4      6

                           Functional Description  2-39









2.2.10 Function Register

   The Function Register, Figure 2-15, consists of two
   flip-flops and drivers connected to the data lines
   and the tricolor Function LED on the rear panel of
   the peripheral repeater. This register is addressed
   as described in Table 2-6. The register format is
   described in Figure 2-16 and Table 2-16.

   The Function LED glows either red, yellow, or
   green, as follows:

    _
      Red
    _

      When the peripheral repeater is in manufacturing
      mode, the Function LED glows red, except when
      the Function Register is being tested.

    _
      Yellow
    _

      During power-up, the Function LED glows yellow.
      If an error that will make the system unusable
      is detected during power-up, the following
      actions occur:

       1. The Function LED remains yellow.

       2. An error code is displayed in the Diagnostic
         Register.

       3. The peripheral repeater does not go into
         operational mode.

      Errors that prevent the peripheral repeater
      from entering operational mode are 8031
      errors detected by the 8031 tests listed in
      Section 3.2.

      If there are no errors that make the peripheral
      repeater unusable, the Function LED will turn
      green.








2-40  Functional Description









    _
      Green
    _

      After the Function LED turns green, the
      peripheral repeater waits for the KA800 to
      respond to the diagnostic report with an
      ACK/NAK (see Section 2.3), indicating that the
      communications link between the KA800 and the
      peripheral repeater is established. If the link
      is not established, a KA800 error code is loaded
      into the Diagnostic Register and the peripheral
      repeater enters operational mode. If the link
      is later established, the error code is cleared.
      Table 2-18 gives a summary of the Diagnostic and
      Function LED indications.

2.2.12 Power Up and Power Monitor Circuits

   The Power Up and Power Monitor circuits are shown
   in Figure 2-19. The Power Up circuit consists of
   an RC circuit and several inverters. When power
   is turned on, the RC circuit charges up to a HIGH
   level at the input to the first of three Schmitt-
   trigger inverters (ST INVT), which provide the PWR
   UP A L and PWR UP B L outputs. A buffer inverter
   (BFFR INVT) provides the PWR UP H output.

   The Power Monitor is based on four comparators
   which sense overvoltage and under-voltage condi-
   tions in the +12V and -12V supplies. The +2V refer-
   ence input for the four comparators (two OVER and
   two UNDER) is provided by an operational amplifier
   (+2V REF), which is controlled by a 1.25V zener
   diode. The other input to each of the comparators
   is a voltage divider.

   Under normal conditions, the voltage dividers
   (>+2V) for the overvoltage comparators provide
   an input level that is greater than +2V, and
   the voltage dividers (<+2V) for the overvoltage
   comparators provide an input level that is
   less than +2V. In this state, the output of the
   comparators is HIGH and the preset input to the
   flip-flop (F/F) is not asserted. The F/F is cleared
   at power up, and the Power Status LED (PWR LED)
   glows green.

   If the comparator input from either >+2V divider is
   less than +2V, or the comparator input from either
   <+2V divider is greater than +2V, the output of the
   associated comparator will go LOW, asserting the
   preset input to the F/F and causing the PWR LED to
   glow red.

   The monitor reacts to over and under voltage
   conditions in excess of +12V+15% and -12V+15%.

2.3 Operational Firmware

   The peripheral repeater operational firmware and
   diagnostic firmware occupy less than 4 kbytes of
   the 8-kbyte program memory ROM on the PRB. The
   diagnostic firmware is described in Chapter 3. All
   the firmware is run by the 8031 microprocessor.

   When power is turned on, the diagnostics are run.
   When testing is completed, the diagnostics leave
   the peripheral repeater in a known state:

    _
      Data memory is initialized.
    _

    _
      Queues are cleared.
    _

    _
      The DC349 ARTs are set to the default inter-
    _
      active device baud rates and data formats (see
      Appendix A).

    _
      The Diagnostic and Function registers are set to
    _
      the appropriate values.

    _
      A system status area containing peripheral
    _
      repeater status is setup.

   On completion of the self-test diagnostics, a
   diagnostic report is sent to the KA800, and the
   peripheral repeater enters operational mode.
   If there are no other messages to transmit,
   the peripheral repeater waits 10 seconds for an
   ACK/NAK (acknowledge/negative acknowledge) from
   the KA800. (Note that the ACK/NAK timeout for all
   other packets is 20 ms.) Reception of the ACK/NAK
   indicates a communications link is established
   between the peripheral repeater and the KA800.
   If the ACK/NAK is not received, an error code is
   loaded into the Diagnostic Register.

   In either case, if the diagnostics have been com-
   pleted without error, the peripheral repeater
   enters operational mode. When the operational
   firmware starts running, the DC349 ARTs are en-
   abled, providing communications between the inter-
   active devices and the KA800 through the peripheral




                           Functional Description  2-55









   repeater. In operational mode, the peripheral re-
   peater is a communications concentrator between the
   interactive devices and the KA800.

   A "keep-alive" timer is also enabled and is used
   to indicate that the link between the peripheral
   repeater and KA800 is active. For example, in the
   VAXstation 8000, the KA800 has a "watch-dog" timer
   with a 10-second interval. When it receives a null
   keep-alive message from the peripheral repeater, it
   resets its watch-dog timer.

2.3.1 Device Identification

   The KA800 sends data to a physical port address.
   The address is taken from a KA800-maintained
   table of which device is attached to which DC349
   port. This table identifies the device attached to
   the rear panel device connectors as follows (see
   Figure 2-6 and Table 2-22 for port and connector
   identification):

    1. KA800 Port--If the KA800 is not connected, the
      system is inoperable.

    2. LK201 Port--The KA800 ROM-based firmware checks
      for the LK201 keyboard. This keyboard is
      required as part of the host-processor system
      console.

    3. Spare Port--If the spare port is connected,
      the attached device will be determined by the
      KA800 RAM-resident, user-supplied, operational
      firmware.

    4. Other Ports--In its self-test report (sent at
      power-up or on request), the peripheral repeater
      reports which ports have an        device-
                                  ______
                                  active
      present signal (any port except the KA800 port,
      LK201 keyboard port, or spare port).

      If the present device has the same connector
      configuration as another device (for example,
      the mouse and tablet), the KA800 determines




2-56  Functional Description









      which type of device is connected by requesting
      a self-test report from the device.

      A device is marked as not present or unknown
      if:

       _
         It's device present signal is inactive.
       _

       _
         It fails to respond to a self-test request
       _
         from the KA800.

2.3.2 Communications Overview

   All data received and transmitted by the peripheral
   repeater is handled by interrupt routines. These
   include routines to handle packets to and from the
   KA800 and various multibyte commands and reports
   to and from the peripheral devices. The interrupt
   routines assemble/disassemble packets and move
   the packets/data to and from transmit and receive
   queues.

   In general, data is transferred from the KA800
   receive queue (receive queue 7) to some other
   channel transmit queue; and from some peripheral
   channel receive queue to the KA800 transmit queue
   (transmit queue 7).

2.3.2.1 Queues and Interrupt Routines

   Transmit and Receive Queues:
                                 There are eight
   transmit queues and eight receive queues. A
   background process constantly scans the transmit
   and receive queues to see if they are empty. If
   the receive queue for a particular peripheral
   channel is not empty, its contents are transferred
   to transmit queue 7 (the transmit queue to the
   KA800). If a transmit queue is not empty, then the
   transmitter for that channel is enabled.

   Commands from the KA800 to the peripheral repeater
   are received in receive queue 7 (the KA800 receive
   queue) and placed in transmit queue 8, where they
   are interpreted by the peripheral repeater. Receive




                           Functional Description  2-57









   queue 8 is also special in that it is primarily
   used internally by the peripheral repeater.

   The Timer Interrupts Routine (described below)
   maintains the Send Keep Alive Flag. If this flag
   is set, then the Keep Alive Packet is loaded into
   transmit queue 7 (the transmit queue to the KA800).

   Receive Interrupt Routine:
                               This routine does the
   following:

    _
      Assembles data received from a peripheral device
    _
      and places it in the receive queue associated
      with the device port.

    _
      Disassembles packets received from the KA800
    _
      and places the data in receive queue 7 (the
      queue for the KA800 port). The data includes
      a peripheral device ID, which enables the
      background process to move the data to the
      transmit queue associated with the device port.

   Transmit Interrupt Routine:
                                This routine does the
   following:

    _
      Transmits data to a peripheral from the transmit
    _
      queue associated with the device port.

    _
      Assembles data into packets and transmits the
    _
      packet to the KA800 from transmit queue 7 (the
      transmit queue associated with the KA800 port).

    _
      Resets the keep-alive timer.
    _

    _
      Transmits ACK/NAK.
    _

   Timer Interrupts Routine:
                              This routine does the
   following:

    _
      Sets the Send Keep Alive Flag if time expires.
    _

    _
      Includes timers for peripheral data packeting,
    _
      ACK/NAK, and port off/on functions.







2-58  Functional Description









   Reports received from the peripheral devices are
   considered complete if the number of characters
   received equals the maximum report size for that
   device, or a character timeout occurs. In other
   words, there is a maximum report size associated
   with each port as well as a timeout based on the
   baud rate for that port.

   For example, Appendix A shows that the maximum
   report size for the VSXXX-AB Tablet is the position
   report at 5 bytes, while its diagnostic report
   is 4 bytes. Because the tablet diagnostic report
   does not equal the maximum report size, character
   timeout is used to indicate the end of the report.
   At 4800 baud and 11 bits per character (1 start
   bit, 8 data bits, 2 stop bits), each character is
   transmitted in approximately 2.3 ms. Therefore,
   the timer for the tablet port is set to 2.3 ms.
   After the last character of the diagnostic report
   is sent, this timer expires, indicating that the
   report is complete.

2.3.2.2 Communications Protocol

   Packets are exchanged between the peripheral
   repeater and KA800 as follows (see Figure 2-20).

                 Format





                         ASD-1120






   The originator sends its data and waits for an
   ACK (acknowledge) or NAK (negative acknowledge).
   If NAK is returned, the originator retransmits
   the previous packet. The receiving device, which
   sent the NAK, will discard the previous packet,
   and respond to the retransmitted packet as a new
   packet.

   When the KA800 sends a T or R command to the
   peripheral repeater, it expects either an ACK or
   NAK to the command packet, and it also expects to
   receive a packet with the Reply bit (04) set in the
   DEV ID byte.

   If an error occurs, the System Error bit (07) is
   set in the DEV ID byte and the packet contains only
   an error byte.

   The packet format is shown in Figure 2-21 and
   described in Table 2-20. The DEV ID byte format is
   shown in Figure 2-22 and described in Table 2-22.
   The error byte codes are listed in Table 2-21.

         Reply bit: clear

         Device ID: 0 through 6




2-66  Functional Description









   There are no peripheral repeater commands for
   testing individual peripherals.

2.3.2.4 Overrun Errors

   If a device overrun error occurs, data may be
   lost. When the peripheral repeater gets an overrun
   error and continues to receive data from that
   device before it can empty the device's queue, the
   receiver for that device is turned off for 10 ms.
   The receiver is then turned on, and received data
   is assembled into a packet and placed in the KA800
   transmit queue. Data transmitted by the device
   during the 10 ms receiver-off time is lost.

2.3.2.5 Maximum Bytes per Transmission

   Device responses or reports transmitted to the
   peripheral repeater are limited to a maximum of
   six consecutive data bytes. If a peripheral device
   transmits more than six consecutive data bytes
   without a null period between bytes, the peripheral
   repeater assembles separate packets, each with a
   maximum of six data bytes.

   Packets transmitted to the peripheral repeater from
   the KA800 are not checked for a maximum number
   of data bytes. However, KA800 packets should
   be limited to no more than nine data bytes. The
   peripheral repeater can safely store up to 256
   packets, each having nine data bytes, and warn the
   KA800 if a queue overflow occurs. Alternatively,
   the peripheral repeater can accept larger packets
   less frequently; for example, it can accept 128
   packets, each having 18 data bytes, with a longer
   null period between packets.

2.3.2.6 Timers

   Device Intercharacter Timer:
                                 Timers are used to
   handle the assembly of device data into packets
   for transmission to the KA800. When the peripheral
   repeater receives a null period between bytes from
   a device, it closes the packet and places it on the
   KA800 transmit queue. The null period is equal to
   two character times, based on the baud rate of the
   device port.

   KA800 Intercharacter Timer:
                                By default, the null
   time between bytes received from the KA800 is 10
   ms. If this time expires, the peripheral repeater
   transmits a NAK to the KA800. Note that this
   intercharacter timer is not the same as ACK/NAK
   timer described below. If the KA800's default baud
   rate is changed, the intercharacter timer reverts
   to two character times, based on the new baud rate.

   ACK/NAK Timer:
                   This is a 20 ms timer, set as
   soon as the last byte (checksum) in a packet is
   transmitted to the KA800. If this time expires
   before the KA800 returns an ACK or NAK, the
   peripheral repeater transmits the next packet in
   the KA800 transmit queue.

   Keep-Alive Timer:
                      If no other packets are sent to
   the KA800 before this 10 second timer expires, a
   null packet is transmitted to the KA800.

2.3.3 Peripheral Repeater Commands

   The KA800 encodes the following commands in the
   data bytes of a packet to the peripheral repeater.

2.3.3.7 T Command (Self-Test)

   In response to this command, the peripheral
   repeater runs self-test and returns a self-test
   report, including configuration information, to
   the KA800. This command temporarily disconnects
   the peripheral repeater from the KA800 for less
   than 10 seconds. The command packet format is shown
   in Figure 2-23, where bytes 1, 2, 3, and 5 are
   as described in Table 2-20. Byte 4 has the value
   84 (54_₁₆), the ASCII value for the letter T. The
   self-test report is described in Section 2.3.3.2.

2.3.3.2 Self-Test Report

   The peripheral repeater transmits this report to
   the KA800 at the completion of self-test either at
   power up or in response to a self-test command, and
   in response to a report status command. The report
   packet format is shown in Figure 2-24, where bytes
   1 and 8 are as described in Table 2-20. Bytes 2
   through 7 are as follows:

    _
      Byte 2 is the device ID byte and has a value of
    _
      23 (17_₁₆). This value indicates that the device
      ID (bits <03:00>) is 7 and the Reply bit (bit
      04) is set.

    _
      Byte 3 is the number of data bytes and has a
    _
      value of 4.

    _
      Byte 4 is a two-digit hexadecimal error code,
    _
      different from byte 5 (see Table 2-19 for the
      error codes).

                                            Diagnostics
_______________________________________________________



   This chapter describes the peripheral repeater
   diagnostics and how they are used.


3.1 Introduction

   The peripheral repeater firmware includes diagnos-
   tic tests that are run at power-up for self-test,
   on command for fault isolation, and for manufactur-
   ing tests. These are all the same diagnostics, with
   additional diagnostics for manufacturing mode. The
   diagnostics check the peripheral repeater logic.
   They do not test attached devices, request attached
   devices to run self-tests, or report the results
   of attached device self-tests. The operational and
   diagnostic firmware are resident in the 8-kbyte
   program memory ROM on the PRB. Operational firmware
   is described in Section 2.3.

   At power-up, the diagnostics have control of the
   peripheral repeater and perform self-tests on the
   logic. If the appropriate loopback is connected
   to the KA800 port on the peripheral repeater, the
   diagnostics run in manufacturing mode.





                                       Diagnostics  3-1









   In manufacturing mode the diagnostics loop
   continuously and do not enter operational mode. No
   devices are attached, and loopbacks are connected
   to all DC349 ports. If an error is detected in this
   mode, the diagnostics loop continuously on the test
   that detected the error.

   The peripheral repeater mode is reported in the
   tricolor Function LED and the diagnostic status
   is reported in the eight diagnostic LEDs. These
   LEDs are driven by the Function and Diagnostic
   registers, described in Chapter 2, and are
   located on the peripheral repeater rear panel. In
   manufacturing mode, the Function LED is always red
   (except during the Function Register test).

   The following is a list of some of the diagnostics'
   capabilities and limitations.

    _
      The diagnostics execute the manufacturing test
    _
      and power-up tests in less than 10 seconds.

    _
      The diagnostics will isolate the peripheral
    _
      repeater if it is the failing FRU (field
      replaceable unit).

    _
      When possible, the diagnostics indicate
    _
      which peripheral repeater component(s) failed
      (hardware fault isolation to the component level
      is not a diagnostic design goal).

    _
      Report detected hardware failures in the
    _
      diagnostic LEDs.

    _
      Report VR290 monitor failure as a system error
    _
      in the diagnostic LEDs.

3.2 Self-Test

   The power-up self-test verifies peripheral repeater
   operation at power-up or on command.

   The power-up self-test tests the peripheral
   repeater circuit board extensively, but does not
   fully test the transmitter/receiver side of the
   DC349 OCTALART. The power-up self-test includes:

    _
      8031 microprocessor tests:
    _

         Internal RAM

         Programmable timers

         Interrupts

         Condition codes (Processor Status Word
         register)

         Internal I/O ports 0 and 2

         Addressing (data pointer)

    _
      Peripheral repeater circuit board tests:
    _

         SRAM

         ROM (pseudocyclic redundancy check)

         Diagnostic and Function registers

         DC349 registers and local loopback

         DC349 interrupts

3.2.1 Running Self-Test

   Self-test is run automatically at power-up. In the
   VAXstation 8000, it can also be run on command as
   a subtest under the KA800 self-test RBD (ROM-based
   diagnostic). For information on running KA800 RBDs,
   see the                              .

3.2.2 Exiting Self-Test

   At the completion of self-test, the Function LED
   turns green and the peripheral repeater waits
   for the KA800 to respond to the diagnostic report
   with an ACK/NAK (see Section 2.3), indicating that
   the communications link between the KA800 and the
   peripheral repeater is established. If the link
   is not established, a KA800 error code is loaded
   into the Diagnostic Register and the peripheral
   repeater enters operational mode. If the link is
   later established, the error code is cleared.


3.3 Manufacturing Mode

   The peripheral repeater is put into manufacturing
   mode by connecting the special manufacturing loop-
   back to the KA800-port rear-panel connector, J2.
   This loopback connects pin 7 of 8031 microprocessor
   Port 1 to ground. When this loopback is connected,
   the tricolor Function LED glows red (except dur-
   ing the Function Register test). The manufacturing
   mode tests expect loopbacks to be attached to the
   rear panel connectors for all the DC349 ports with
   device present signals implemented:


   Port
                     1      2      3      4      6



   Connector
                    J8     J7     J3     J4     J14



   In manufacturing mode, the same tests are executed
   as in power-up self-test. Two additional tests are
   also run:

    _
      An external loopback test tests the transceiver/receiver
    _
      side of all the DC349 ports, including the con-
      nection to the rear panel connectors.




3-4  Diagnostics









    _
      All DC349 port DSR (data set ready) and DCD
    _
      (carrier detect) functions are tested. This
      verifies that:

         DSR and DCD pins not used for device present
         are connected to ground at the DC349.
         This sets the DSR and DCD bits in the
         channel's Status Register (see Figure 2-9
         and Table 2-10).

         DCD pins which are used for device present
         are connected to ground at the port's rear
         panel connector. This clears the DCD bit
         in the channel's Status Register because of
         the intervening inverter (see Figure 2-9 and
         Table 2-10).

   It is these two additional manufacturing tests
   that require external loopbacks on all DC349 port
   connectors.

   In this mode, the diagnostics will loop continu-
   ously until either peripheral repeater power is
   turned off or the special manufacturing loopback is
   removed from the host port connector. In addition,
   the manufacturing test will loop continuously if a
   hard or intermittent error is detected, displaying
   the number of the failing test in the diagnostic
   LEDs.

   Normally, the peripheral repeater is not repaired
   in the field; the entire internal assembly is
   replaced. This chapter briefly describes what to
   check before replacing the internal assembly.


4.1 Problem Summary

   Peripheral repeater failures are indicated in two
   ways: by the front panel Power LED and/or by the
   KA800 RBDs. Table 4-1 lists the symptoms, possible
   causes, and action to take when a peripheral
   repeater failure is indicated.
