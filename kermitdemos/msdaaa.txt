File MSDAAA.HLP

Files whose name start with MSD... are demo files for various features
found in MS-Kermit 3.0 and later, like Heath graphics, TEK4010 graphics,
and VT320 emulation. Since they do not consist entirely of printable
ASCII characters, they have been stored on CUVMA in boo-encoded form.
To decode them, run them through MSBPCT; e.g.,

         MSBPCT MSDUSA.BOO

This will create a binary file whose extension indicates what feature it
is supposed to be a demo for; in the example above, USA.TEK will show off
MS-Kermit's Tektronix 4010 capabilities. - The original file (MSDUSA.BOO)
is not needed after running MSBPCT.

To view the demo, start MS-DOS Kermit and put it in the right frame of mind
via SET TERM ...; then REPLAY the file just created. E.g.,

         SET TERM TEK
         REPLAY USA.TEK

A list of demo files as of 1 March, 1990, follows:

   Network name   True name        SET TERM ...
