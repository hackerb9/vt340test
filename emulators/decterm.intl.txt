2.7.3.9 DECterm Graphics V1.1 The following information is specific to
DECterm graphics:

	In some cases, a private colormap is created in DECterm. This
	private colormap is created when ReGIS or Sixel graphics are
	displayed in the window and a sufficient number of colors from the
	default colormap cannot be allocated. The result is that when the
	DECterm window has input focus, the colormap changes for the
	entire workstation. The default colormap is four colors on a
	four-plane or monochrome system and 16 colors on color systems
	with more than four planes.

	To restore a DECterm window to the default colormap, select Clear
	Display from the Commands menu to clear the window. Then select
	Reset Terminal from the Commands menu to reset the terminal.

	Only graphics, not text, are written to the graphics backing
	store. When part of a window has to be redrawn in DECterm, the
	graphics portion of the window is drawn first, then the text is
	overlaid. As a result, the redrawn window might not look the same
	as the original picture.

	ReGIS addresses the entire window, not just 24 rows and 80
	columns, so the aspect ratio between text and graphics might not
	always be the same as on the VT330 or VT340 terminal.

	The following ReGIS features are not implemented:
	    Command Display mode
	    Scrolling
	    Output cursors

    4    Using Screen-Handling Routines for Character-Cell Terminals
    4.2    Drawing Ruled Lines in a DECterm Window

    Programming guides for video terminals discuss how you use ANSI escape
    sequences to perform operations, such as inserting and deleting
    characters, inserting and removing blank lines, and requesting
    character display in double height and width. Because a DECterm window
    is a terminal emulator, these escape sequences also apply to programs
    that display text and graphics in a DECterm window.

    Digital UNIX enhancements for Asian languages include additional
    escape sequences for drawing and removing ruled lines in a specified
    area of a DECterm window. These additional escape sequences allow
    applications to construct tables and diagrams. The feature is a market
    requirement for Japanese terminals but has been incorporated into
    DECterm software for all terminal types.

    The following sections describe the escape sequences that draw and
    erase lines according to pattern and area parameters.

4.2.1    Drawing Ruled Lines in a Pattern

The escape sequence identified by the mnemonic DECDRLBR draws ruled lines on
the boundaries of a rectangular area according to a specified pattern. The

When the DECDRLBR escape sequence is received from an application, DECterm
software draws ruled lines on one or more of the boundaries of the area between
the coordinates(Px,Py ) and(Px+Plx-1, Py+Ply -1) according to the pattern
specified in P1. Consider the following example:

CSI 15 ; 1 ; 5 ; 1 ; 2 , r

The preceding escape sequence causes DECterm software to draw ruled lines as
shown in Figure 4-1.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Figure 4-1: Drawing Ruled Lines with the DECDRLBR Sequence

[FIGU_006]


DECterm software draws ruled lines that are one pixel in width. When the
display scrolls, these lines correctly scroll as if text.

Figure 4-2 and the table following the figure describe the bit pattern that the
DECDRLBR parameters map to.

┠────────┼───────────┼────────────────────────────────────┨
┃ Bit 0  │ 1         │ Draws line on the bottom boundary  ┃

┠────────┼───────────┼────────────────────────────────────┨
┃ Bit 3  │ 8         │ Draws line on the left boundary    ┃
┗━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
The DECDRLBR parameters are more completely described in the following list:


  • Pattern of ruled lines(P1 )

    The pattern is a bitmask that controls how the ruled lines are drawn on the
    boundaries of the area. Ruled lines are drawn according to whether the bits
    for the boundaries are set on or off. For example, ruled lines are drawn on
    all boundaries if P1 is set to 15 and on the top and bottom boundary if P1
    is set to 5:

    Boundary : Bottom   Right   Top    Left
    P1       = Bit0   + Bit1  + Bit2 + Bit3
    P1       = 1      + 2     + 4    + 8      = 15
    P1       = 1              + 4             =  5

  • Absolute position of the start point(Px,Py )

    Px is the starting column position and Py is the starting row position. If
    you omit these parameters or explicitly set them to 0 (zero), the starting
    position is at column 1 and row 1. In other words, the upper left corner of
    the rectangle is at the coordinates (1,1).

  • Size of the area(Plx,Ply )

    Plx is the width of the area in columns and Ply is the height of the area
    in rows. If you omit these parameters or explicitly set them to 0 (zero),
    the area is 1 column in width and 1 row in height.

4.2.5    Determining if the DECterm Device Setting Supports Ruled Lines

The feature that allows applications to draw ruled lines is enabled only when a
DECterm window is emulating a terminal type that supports this feature. Your
application can check for device support by requesting primary device
attributes from DECterm software.

VT terminals and DECterm software return a primary device attributes report on
request from applications. If the extension value 43 is included in this
report, drawing ruled lines is enabled for the device. This extension is valid
at a level-2 video display or higher. For example, if a DECterm window is
emulating a VT382-J terminal, which is the Japanese version of a VT382, the
primary device attributes are generated as follows:

CSI ? 63 ; 1 ; 2 ; 4 ; 5 ; 6 ; 7 ; 8 ; 10 ; 15 ; 43 c

Applications can send either the CSI c or CSI 0 c escape sequence to a VT
terminal or DECterm software to request a device attributes report.

4.3    DECterm Programming Restrictions

This section discusses DECterm software restrictions with respect to terminal
programming features discussed in hardware manuals.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4.3.1    Downline Loadable Characters

DECterm software does not support the downline loadable characters that are
used for preloading and on-demand loading of terminals. The software ignores
the escape sequence for these characters.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4.3.2    DRCS Characters

DECterm software supports only the Standard Character Set (SCS) component of
DRCS. When DECterm software receives the SCS characters, it searches the X
window server for the fonts with XLFD named as -*-dec-drcs and treats them as a
soft character set. The software ignores the DECDLD control string sent by the
terminal programming application.
