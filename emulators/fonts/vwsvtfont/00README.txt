This font was included on DEC's Freeware CD for VMS v4.0.

It was created by DEC and recommended as the font to use on their
VT340 emulator, DECTerm, in order to have the correct proportions for
ReGIS graphics.

These .pcf files were extracted from dxfont_axp_vwsvt0_pcf010.a, which
was downloaded from: https://www.digiater.nl/openvms/freeware/v40/vwsvt/

The .a extension indicates the file is an OpenVMS Backup Saveset
archive. To extract it, hackerb9 used a program called vmsbackup which
is available from: ftp://ftp.process.com/vms-freeware/free-vms/
