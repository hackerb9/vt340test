# VWSVT font

This bitmap font was included on DEC's Freeware CD for VMS v4.0. It
includes several bitmap terminal fonts that are meant to be used
together to make a single typeface.

### Fonts in this typeface

* Weight: normal or bold
* Width: narrow, normal, wide, or double-wide
* Height: normal or double-height
* Encoding: Latin-1 or DEC Technical

## Usage

You can run the `dir2alias` script in this directory to create the
fonts.alias file and add the directory to the X11 font path.

The fonts.alias file exists to allow for short names, so one can use
"vwsvt0-dblwide19" instead of
"-digital-vwsvt0-medium-r-double*wide--20-190-75-75-c-200-iso8859-1"

Note that some applications will not show the font by default as it is
a bitmap, not scalable. For example, one may need to disable scalable
font rendering in xterm.

```
xterm -fn vwsvt0-19 -xrm 'xterm*renderFont: False'
```

### Character encoding

Encoding is in Latin-1 (and "DEC" for graphics) which both use 8-bit
characters from 128 to 255 and are thus incompatible with Unicode.
You'll need to set your shell's encoding to Latin-1 to have them
display correctly â€” e.g., `export LANG=en_US.iso8859-1`. Not all
systems include Latin-1 support by default. For example, on Debian
GNU/Linux, you'll need to uncomment the line that says
`en_US.ISO-8859-1` in the file /etc/locale.gen and then run
`locale-gen`.

Note that the "dectech" fonts include the DEC Special Graphics font in
G0 (7-bit ASCII) and Dec Technical Character Set in G1 ("high ASCII").

## Installation

You can copy this directory to /usr/local/share/fonts/vwsvtfont then
add the directory to your system's font search path. For example, for
X11, you can use:

```bash
xset fp+ /usr/local/share/fonts/vwsvtfont
xset fp rehash
```

## History

This font was created by DEC and recommended as the font to use on
their VT340 emulator, DECTerm, in order to have the correct
proportions for ReGIS graphics.

These .pcf files were extracted from dxfont_axp_vwsvt0_pcf010.a, which
was downloaded from: https://www.digiater.nl/openvms/freeware/v40/vwsvt/

The .a extension indicates the file is an OpenVMS Backup Saveset
archive. To extract it, hackerb9 used a program called vmsbackup which
is available from: ftp://ftp.process.com/vms-freeware/free-vms/
