## What is this?

In the decades since the DEC VT340 terminal was released, knowledge of
how it functioned has been lost. Mostly for archaeological purposes,
but also so that the [lsix](https://github.com/hackerb9/lsix) program















































































































































































































































































































































































































works correctly, [hackerb9](https://github.com/hackerb9) purchased a
VT340+ and is running tests, many of which were submitted by
[j4james](https://github.com/j4james), and documenting the results
here.
