# This ode file describes the functioning of a so-called swinging
# Atwood's machine.  An ordinary Atwood's machine consists of a taut cord
# draped over a pulley, with a mass attached to the cord at each end.
# Normally, the heavier mass (M) would win against the lighter mass (m),
# and draw it upward.  A swinging Atwood's machine allows the lighter
# mass to swing back and forth as well as move vertically.

#    The `print l, ldot' statement requests that the vertical position
# and vertical velocity of the lighter mass be printed out at each step.
# If you run the command

#      ode < atwoods | graph -T regis -x 9 11 -y -1 1 -m 0 -S 1 -X l -Y ldot

# you will obtain a real-time plot.  The `-m 0' option requests that
# successive data points not be joined by line segments, and the `-S 1'
# option requests that plotting symbol #1 (a dot) be plotted at the
# location of each point.  As you will see if you run this command, the
# heavy mass does not win against the lighter mass.  Instead the machine
# oscillates non-periodically.  Since the motion is non-periodic, the
# plot benefits from being drawn as a sequence of unconnected points.
