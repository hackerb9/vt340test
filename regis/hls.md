# The Hue-Lightness-Saturation Colorspace

If you already know HLS from computer graphics, then this will be
comfortable with the one change being that a hue angle of zero is blue
on the VT340, not red. 

Hue is an angle that can range from 0 to 360. Lightness and saturation
are both percents from 0 to 100.

## Examples

XXX TODO 


### Converting hls to rgb and viceversa

[hls2rgb.py](hls2rgb.py)


### Color chooser in firmware

Use the built-in color chooser in the VT340's firmware to
explore the 4096 colors available by adjusting HLS.
