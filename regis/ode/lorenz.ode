# The Lorenz model, a system of three coupled ODE's with parameter r,
# one of the most famous _strange attractors_ in mathematics.

# To graph:  ode < lorenz | graph -T regis -C -x -10 10 -y -10 10

# The Lorenz model, a third order system.
# Interesting cases are r = 26, 2.5<t<30, x = z = 0, y = 1
# and r = 17, 1<t<50, x = z = 0, y = 1.
x' = -3*(x-y)
y' = -x*z+r*x-y
z' = x*y-z

r = 26
x = 0
y = 1
z = 0

print x, y
