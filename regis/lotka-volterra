# This ode file draws a phase portrait for the so-called
# Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model. Suppose that in a lake there are
# two species of fish: A (the prey) who live by eating a plentiful
# supply of plants, and B (the predator) who eat A. Let x(t) be the
# population of A and y(t) the population of B at time t. A crude
# model for the interaction of A and B is given by the equations

#      x' = x(a-by)
#      y' = y(cx-d)

# where a, b, c, d are positive constants. 

# To graph:      ode < lotka-volterra | graph -T regis -C -x 0 5 -y 0 5
