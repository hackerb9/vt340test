If you are a person who uses \TeX , and you would like to include some simple
graphics along with you document, or would like to see what the document looks
like before you print it out, today is your lucky day.

The drawing above shows the relationship of several programs, the ones in
circles, and the types of files they use and produce. Normally \TeX\ produces a
`.dvi' file which could only be sent to the printer. Now there is a new program
to convert the `.dvi' for display on a terminal. There is also new input into
\TeX\ in the form of a `.pic' file. This file is basically a screen dump of
graphics drawn by mdraw. In order to easily use this `.pic' file in a \TeX\
file, another \TeX\ file is created which holds all the bizarre commands to 
handle the `.pic' file. All that needs to be done to the top document is 
to include this supporting \TeX\ file.
