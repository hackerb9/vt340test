This contains the initial release of MDRAW code and assorted utilities.

Included are source files and executable for mdraw itself along with
the converter for mdraw files into sixel files.

Also included are files describing how to set up and how to use mdraw. These
come in TeX format and in plain text. The user guide is in `help.txt' and
the setup stuff is in `start.txt'.

There is a command file start.com which sets up the directories needed and 
the symbols and logicals that need to be set up. (Hows that for repetitive 
redundancy?) Just change the directory path and anything else you like.

There is a directory `[.samples]' that has, guess what, samples in it.
There is a read.me in there describing how to look at them and print them
out, once mdraw and company is set up.

If problems arise, or major bugs strike, feel free to contact me at:

Note: 
 The two fortran programs are slight modifications of the originals from a 
 previous DECUS tape. The previous author (Strickland) is in no way responsible
 for anything that might go wrong. Nothing should go wrong, but if it does, 
 complain to me. Thank you.
