# ISO Table of APL Characters

Unfortunately, ISO never standardized a table of APL characters with
code points. A working draft found preserved in amber at
-https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~ljdickey/apl-rep/tables/ shows the
thoughts of the standardization committee, a few of which are relevant
for the DEC VT340.

* 131 different APL symbols (not including alphabetic letters) were
  identified. The VT340 can only store 94 characters in a soft font,
  so clearly some compromises had to be made. Or, so you would think.
  Digital's [APL Font](../aplfontb9/) actually only contains 87
  unique characters. (76 to 7C are just copies of 7E, Squish Quad).

* One character that the VT340 font can show that isn't part of the
  standard is 7D, "OUT". In the original version of APL, this was
  shown by having the letters 'O', 'U', and 'T' typed overstruck in the
  same place on the paper.

* Digital's [APL Font](../aplfontb9/) could have saved 26 characters
  by leaving out the underscored alphabet (A̲ B̲ C̲). The standards
  committee said that that alphabet was an artifact of the 1960s
  hardware which could not show lowercase. With the invention of
  "glass TTYs", there was some confusion about whether underscored
  letters were supposed to be upper or lowercase, but the committee
  may have been referring to DEC when they said,
 a
  <blockquote>
  “at least one implementer added to the confusion by including three copies of the alphabet,

	a to z,

	A to Z, and

	𝐴̲ to 𝑍̲. ”

Note that Hackerb9 has also added the equivalent character code in the
various character sets that the VT340 would have access to when using
DEC's recommended ["Composite APL Character Set"](../../charset/DECAPL.md).

Sidenote: TCS, the Technical Character Set, despite having many Greek
letters that might have been useful, is not part of the Composite APL
Character Set. If TCS had been used instead of Latin-1, it could have
saved many glyphs that the DEC APL font redundantly provided: (⍺, ∇,
∆, ÷, ↓, ∨, ∪, ⌊, ⊤, ≥, ⍳, ←, ⊂, ≤, ≠, ⍴, →, ⊃, ≡, ⍵, ↑, ∧, ∩).
