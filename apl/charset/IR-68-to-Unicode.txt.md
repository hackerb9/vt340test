# Notes on Unicode's mapping table from APL

This document refers to b9's [IR-68-to-Unicode.txt](IR-68-to-Unicode.txt)
(2025), a fixed copy of [Unicode's file of the same name][Uni68] (2020).

[Uni68]: https://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/MISC/APL-ISO-IR-68.TXT "Unicode's old IR-68 mapping, 2020-07-17 22:58:00 GMT."

There appear to be some mistakes in Unicode's chart.

1. Note 7 of the [IR-68][IR68] standard gives examples of characters
   composed using backspace (0x08) that should be "imaged so as to be
   clearly recognizable". One of those, underscored alphabetics, is
   completely missing from the Unicode mapping file.

     * 0x460861 to 0x46087A: `_` + `ùê¥` to `_` + `ùëç`.

   The modern [consensus][consensus] of the APL community is that
   underscored letters were merely a way to differentiate lower and
   uppercase alphabets given the mechanical limitations of the IBM
   selectric type ball. Since, Unicode's IR-68-to-Unicode.txt file
   maps 0x61 to 0x41 (CAPITAL LETTER A), we can safely conclude that
   the underscored alphabet should be rendered as lowercase.

2. The IR-68-to-Unicode file also lists the incorrect IR-68 sequence
   for some characters:

### QUAD DOWNWARDS ARROW

#### Original
```
IR-68       UNICODE
-----       -------
0x46084B	0x2357	#	APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL QUAD DOWNWARDS ARROW (incorrect)
0x4B0846	0x2357	#	APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL QUAD DOWNWARDS ARROW (incorrect)
0x46084B	0x2358	#	APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL QUOTE UNDERBAR
0x4B0846	0x2358	#	APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL QUOTE UNDERBAR
```

In IR-68 UNDERBAR is 46 and SINGLE QUOTE is 4B, so the mapping to Quad
Downwards Arrow is mistaken. That character would be composed in IR-68
of QUAD (4C) and DOWN ARROW (55), but that sequence (0x4C0855,
0x55084C) is missing. Corrected, it would be:

#### Fixed
```
0x4C0855	0x2357	#	APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL QUAD DOWNWARDS ARROW
0x55084C	0x2357	#	APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL QUAD DOWNWARDS ARROW
0x46084B	0x2358	#	APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL QUOTE UNDERBAR
0x4B0846	0x2358	#	APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL QUOTE UNDERBAR
```

### QUAD EQUAL

#### Original
```
    IR-68 	UNICODE
    -----	-------
    0x4C082A	0x2338	#	APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL QUAD EQUAL (incorrect)
    0x2A084C	0x2338	#	APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL QUAD EQUAL (incorrect)
    0x4C082A	0x236F	#	APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL QUAD NOT EQUAL
    0x2A084C	0x236F	#	APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL QUAD NOT EQUAL
```

IR-68 character 2A is NOT EQUALS, the correct entry should be 25 for EQUALS.

#### Fixed
```
    0x4C0825	0x2338	#	APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL QUAD EQUAL
    0x25084C	0x2338	#	APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL QUAD EQUAL
    0x4C082A	0x236F	#	APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL QUAD NOT EQUAL
    0x2A084C	0x236F	#	APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL QUAD NOT EQUAL
```
