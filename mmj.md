# MMJ: DEC's Modified Modular Jack

The VT340 has three MMJ ports: the first and second communication
ports and the printer port. Officially it is called "DEC-423" or
"DECconnect", but colloquially and most commonly it is "MMJ".

<!-- XXX TODO: Put image of back panel here with arrow to MMJ and -->
<!-- showing synonyms: MMJ, DEC-423, DECconnect. -->

Note that using MMJ is not strictly required as the VT340 also has a
standard RS-232 DB-25 connector which can be configured in the VT340
Setup menu to map to the first communication port. However, to get the
most of your VT340, including dual sessions, serial input of
keystrokes, and printing graphics, you'll want MMJ cables.

## Why MMJ is nifty

* Simple "telephone" line cable
* Connect any two devices with that one cable (no more messing with
  null modems to convert DTE/DCE)
* Quick connect/disconnect
* Based on EIA-423-D, so cables can be much longer than RS-232
* Backwards compatible with RS-232 signals

## MMJ to DE-9F Adapter

Since modern computers don't use MMJ, you'll need a female DE-9 RS-232
to MMJ socket adapter. According to [Lammert Bies][lammert] the DEC
model number for this adapter is **H8571-J**.

<!-- XXX TODO: Insert picture of adapter here. -->

Note that the because every MMJ cable is a crossover cable, the
functions associated with the pins swap position (dosey-do). 

| MMJ pins | Function at VT340   | Function after BC16E cable |
|:--------:|---------------------|----------------------------|
| 1        | Data Set Ready      | Data Terminal Ready        |
| 2        | Receive Data+       | Transmit Data+             |
| 3        | Receive Data-       | Transmit Data-             |
| 4        | Transmit Data-      | Receive Data-              |
| 5        | Transmit Data+      | Receive Data+              |
| 6        | Data Terminal Ready | Data Set Ready             |


## Hackerb9's Suggestion for DE-9 to MMJ Wiring

Here's how hackerb9 wired up a 9-pin female to MMJ connector so that,
like original DEC equipment, a PC can be plugged into any MMJ device
using just a single cable. In RS232-speak, all devices (VT340, PC,
printer, etc) are "DTE" and all cables are "crossover" (AKA "null modems").

This is very similar to DEC's H8571-J adapter with one minor
difference: instead of using DTR (DB9 pin 4) on the PC, this connector
uses RTS (DB9 pin 7). Why? Because all modern UNIX systems can handle
RTS/CTS flow control but DTR/DSR support is iffy. In particular, the
Linux kernel still has no support as of 2025.

<ul><i><sub>

go to both DE-9 pins 1 and 8.</sub>

without it programs like `less` and `mesg` would hang forever on open

run `stty clocal`.)</sub> <sub> Pin 8 (Clear To Send) is also useful as it is
common for modern systems to presume hardware flow control (even
though the VT340 does not have it).</sub> <sub>Pin 6 (Data Set Ready) is least
important as [UNIX systems have ignored it for eons][UWR870] in favor
of Carrier Detect (Pin 1). For more considerations, see the [Linux

Despite the VT340 lacking hardware flow control, this wiring works
well for communication. The words you are reading are flowing from a
VT340, over a standard "DEC-423 BC16E" cable, through this homemade
MMJ to DE-9 adapter, to a UNIX host's serial port. _Caveat: Some USB
to RS232 serial adapters lack "on-chip XON/XOFF" and will cause
dropped characters ("â¸®"). See [flowcontrol.md](flowcontrol.md) for details._


### Purchasing Unassembled MMJ-DB9F Adapters

Most of the MMJ-DB9F adapters for sale online come with the pins
disconnected so you can choose how you wish to wire it.

Hackerb9 ordered from Pacific Cable (part no. AD-9FT6-G1D), but [their
website](https://pacificcable.com) is down. It looks like you can get
the same thing from other suppliers, but no promises.

### MMJ Pin 1 is furthest from "thumb" of MMJ latch

In the VT340, DEC assigns the 2nd and 3rd serial-port pins like this
(a 6-pin MMJ DEC-423 port, similar to EIA-423-D):

```
          _______________                 1 - DTR
          |             |                 2 - TXD+
          | 1 2 3 4 5 6 |                 3 - TXD-
          |________    _|                 4 - RXD-
                  |___|                   5 - RXD+
                                          6 - DSR
```

| MMJ Pin | DEC-423 name | Signal    | Wire Color at Jack | DB-25 |
|---------|--------------|-----------|--------------------|-------|
| 1       | Rdy Out      | DTR       | White              | 20    |
| 2       | Tx+          | TxD       | Black              | 2     |
| 3       | Tx-          | GND       | Red                | 7     |
| 4       | Rx-          | GND       | Green              | 7     |
| 5       | Rx+          | RxD       | Yellow             | 3     |
| 6       | Rdy In       | DSR & DCD | Blue               | 6 & 8 |

Note: wire color gets flipped on one plug since DEC-423 always uses
crossover cables.

### BC16E DEC-423 Cable

This is DEC's official MMJ cable. 

<!-- XXX TODO: Insert picture of BC16E cable. -->

| 3          | Red        | Tx-     | Rx-     | Green      | 4          |
| 4          | Green      | Rx-     | Tx-     | Red        | 3          |

| 6          | Blue       | Rdy In  | Rdy Out | White      | 1          |


Instead of using vintage cables which cost a premium, hackerb9
purchased an MMJ crimper and a bag of MMJ plugs to make BC16E cables
out of ordinary 6-wire telephone cable.

### Mark Gleaves MMJ to 9-pin serial with fake RTS/CTS flow control

</summary>

The Linux Documentation Project has a pinout for a cable functionally
similar to the one hackerb9 suggests above. It additionally loops back
the Request to Send (RTS) signal from the PC back into the Carrier
Detect (CD) and Data Terminal Ready (DTR) pins. This seems like a
mistake as RTS and DTR are both _outputs_ pins and one could fry the
serial port if they disagree about what voltage to set the line.

His schematic is:

      DEC MMJ                            Linux PC DB9
    Pin  Signal                           Signal  Pin

                                      |--> DTR !?  4
                                      |--> CD      1
                           (no connection) RI      9

Hackerb9 does NOT RECOMMENDED this cable due to the possibility of
hardware damage.

## Pinout of 9-pin and 25-pin serial connectors

Adapted from the Linux Serial HOWTO chapter 19.

<blockquote>

The pin numbers are often engraved in the plastic of the connector but you may
need a magnifying glass to read them. Note DCD is sometimes labeled CD. The
numbering of the pins on a female connector is read from right to left,
starting with 1 in the upper right corner (instead of 1 in the upper left
corner for the male connector as shown below). --> direction is out of PC.

```

Note that in modern usage, "Request to Send" is a misnomer from the
days of half-duplex. Since the 1980s, the RTS pin has been used for
full-duplex "RTS/CTS hardware handshaking". Some have suggested
renaming it "Ready To Receive".
